This section provides an overview of machine learning\\nand explains how Amazon SageMaker works. If you are a first-time user of Amazon SageMaker, we\\nrecommend that you read the following sections in order:\\nTopics\\n• Machine Learning with Amazon SageMaker (p. 2)\\n• Explore and Preprocess Data (p. 4)\\n• Train a Model with Amazon SageMaker (p. 4)\\n• Deploy a Model in Amazon SageMaker (p. 7)\\nHow It Works: Next Topic\\nMachine Learning with Amazon SageMaker (p. 2)\\nMachine Learning with Amazon SageMaker\\nThis section describes a typical machine learning workflow and summarizes how you accomplish those\\ntasks with Amazon SageMaker.\\nIn machine learning, you \"teach\" a computer to make predictions, or inferences. First, you use an\\nalgorithm and example data to train a model. Then you integrate your model into your application to\\ngenerate inferences in real time and at scale. In a production environment, a model typically learns from\\nmillions of example data items and produces inferences in hundreds to less than 20 milliseconds.\\nThe following diagram illustrates the typical workflow for creating a machine learning model:\\n\\n\\nAs the diagram illustrates, you typically perform the following activities:\\n1. Generate example data—To train a model, you need example data. The type of data that you need\\ndepends on the business problem that you want the model to solve (the inferences that you want\\n\\nthe model to generate). For example, suppose that you want to create a model to predict a number\\ngiven an input image of a handwritten digit. To train such a model, you need example images of\\nhandwritten numbers.\\nData scientists often spend a lot of time exploring and preprocessing, or \"wrangling,\" example data\\nbefore using it for model training. To preprocess data, you typically do the following:\\na. Fetch the data— You might have in-house example data repositories, or you might use datasets\\nthat are publicly available. Typically, you pull the dataset or datasets into a single repository.\\nb. Clean the data—To improve model training, inspect the data and clean it as needed. For example, if\\nyour data has a country name attribute with values United States and US, you might want to\\nedit the data to be consistent.\\nc. Prepare or transform the data—To improve performance, you might perform additional data\\ntransformations. For example, you might choose to combine attributes. If your model predicts the\\nconditions that require de-icing an aircraft, instead of using temperature and humidity attributes\\nseparately, you might combine those attributes into a new attribute to get a better model.\\nIn Amazon SageMaker, you preprocess example data in a Jupyter notebook on your notebook\\ninstance. You use your notebook to fetch your dataset, explore it, and prepare it for model training.\\nFor more information, see Explore and Preprocess Data (p. 4). For more information about\\npreparing data in AWS Marketplace, see data preparation.\\n2. Train a model—Model training includes both training and evaluating the model, as follows:\\n• Training the model— To train a model, you need an algorithm. The algorithm you choose depends\\non a number of factors. For a quick, out-of-the-box solution, you might be able to use one of\\nthe algorithms that Amazon SageMaker provides. For a list of algorithms provided by Amazon\\nSageMaker and related considerations, see Use Amazon SageMaker Built-in Algorithms (p. 56).\\nYou also need compute resources for training. Depending on the size of your training dataset and\\nhow quickly you need the results, you can use resources ranging from a single general-purpose\\ninstance to a distributed cluster of GPU instances. For more information, see Train a Model with\\nAmazon SageMaker (p. 4).\\n• Evaluating the model—After you\\'ve trained your model, you evaluate it to determine whether the\\naccuracy of the inferences is acceptable. In Amazon SageMaker, you use either the AWS SDK for\\nPython (Boto) or the high-level Python library that Amazon SageMaker provides to send requests to\\nthe model for inferences.\\nYou use a Jupyter notebook in your Amazon SageMaker notebook instance to train and evaluate\\nyour model.\\n3. Deploy the model— You traditionally re-engineer a model before you integrate it with your\\napplication and deploy it. With Amazon SageMaker hosting services, you can deploy your model\\nindependently, decoupling it from your application code. For more information, see Deploy a Model on\\nAmazon SageMaker Hosting Services (p. 7).')]"
